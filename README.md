# To-Do Program 📋

A clean and functional **To-Do list application** built with **Vite**, **TypeScript**, **React**, **shadcn-ui**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This project helped me structure reusable components, learn state management, and enhance TypeScript usage—with a touch of **AI-assisted module generation**.

> 💡 Some TypeScript module scaffolding and logic patterns were refined with the help of **AI autotools**, improving coding consistency and speed.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Core Features**  
  - Add, edit, complete, and delete tasks  
  - Input validation and dynamic task lists  
  - Clean UI using shadcn-ui components and Tailwind styling  

- **AI Enhancements**  
  - AI-assisted generation of TypeScript interfaces and utility functions  
  - Intelligent code suggestions to enforce best practices and consistency
